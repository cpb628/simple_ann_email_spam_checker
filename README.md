Activity #2 - Designing AI Solutions with Neural Networks and NLP
simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying text (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails)

1. Introduction to ANN for Text Classification
1.1 Design: Outline the architecture of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying text (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails). Include the input layer, hidden layers, activation functions, and output layer.
1.2 Data Preprocessing: Describe the steps needed to preprocess the text data (e.g., tokenization, vectorization).
1.3 Training Process: Explain how you would train the ANN, including the choice of loss function and optimizer.
1.4 Expected Results: Predict the possible outcomes and how you would evaluate the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

2. Summary and Discussion 
Summary: Summarize your designs and expected outcomes for the ANN, deep learning architecture, and NLP tasks in Presentation File
Challenges: Discuss potential challenges in the implementation and how you might address them.
Improvements: Suggest ways to improve the models and their performance.
Preparation: Prepare a brief summary of your work for a class discussion.
